Welcome to the MineWriter project
====================

This is where we will keeping the source for minewriter.net.

The idea is to let people author books online, which then can be ported into minecraft with the bukkit plugin. 

If you would like to contribute, create a pull request and we may implement it.

Pull Request Guidelines
====================
Pull requests should follow these guidelines:

* K&R Coding style for PHP
For example:

````php
if ($variable == "foo") {
	die("Test");
}
````
* Use TABS, not spaces for indentation. Your tab width should be 4
* HTML tags should be nested with 2 spaces.
* Don't use inline CSS if you can help it - use def.css
* All changes should be discussed via IRC ideally before making a PR (#minewriter on EsperNet)
* Code changes are automatically deployed to the site: http://minewriter.net
* CSS should be K&R with a space before starting braces and after properties:
* 
````css
.container {
  width: 860px; 
}
````
* Indent CSS by two spaces
* Please add comments to PHP code to explain what you are doing :D
